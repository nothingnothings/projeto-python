What's a Block?

Of course a "Blockchain" consists of multiple "Blocks" - and a single Block simply can be considered a data storage/ container. You can store ANY data of your choice in a Block.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are the most prominent use-case of the Blockchain technology but you can also store simple text in Blocks if you want to. Of course using a Blockchain makes most sense for data that should be secure and distributed across a broad network though. Data transparency and safety are key advantages of the Blockchain.

Even when considering Cryptocurrencies, you don't actually store the coins in a Block but rather the transactions between users. A transaction then includes an amount of coins that should be transferred.

In this course, the Blocks we start with only holds a number. So you can think of it as a transaction, though the sender and recipient is missing. But that's something which will be added once we had a look at more complex data structures than simple lists.

Multiple Blocks in a list of Blocks then form the first simple Blockchain. No worries, it'll get more complex than that over the course of the remaining modules!
