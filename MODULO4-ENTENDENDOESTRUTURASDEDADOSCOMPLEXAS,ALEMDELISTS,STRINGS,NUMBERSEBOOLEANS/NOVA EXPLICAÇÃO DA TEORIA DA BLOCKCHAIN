As mentioned earlier, a Blockchain is all about storing data in Blocks. And for a Cryptocurrency, that data are Transactions (NOT Coins!).

Transactions typically require three pieces of information:

Who sends the coins? [sender ]
Who receives the coins? [recipient ]
How many coins are sent? [amount ]
A transaction is treated as an "Open Transaction" until it's included in a new block. Only transactions that are part of a block have been "processed" and their attached amounts are hence available to the recipient.

One Block typically contains more than one Transaction - in this course, we'll simply add all open transactions. Once the Block has been created, the "Open Transactions" are of course cleared.
