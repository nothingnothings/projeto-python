In the last lecture, we added the "Block" class and we used a default argument in its constructor: The time  argument is set to time()  by default.

This actually always creates the same timestamp though - because time()  will only be evaluated once. 

Default arguments in general will only be evaluated once. This means that the second block will receive the same timestamp as the first one.

We don't actually use the timestamp in this course's Blockchain implementation and I again wanted to practice the usage of default arguments, but a better implementation would be the following one:

from time import time

class Block:
    def __init__(self, index, previous_hash, transactions, proof, timestamp=None):
        self.index = index
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.timestamp = time() if timestamp is None else timestamp
        self.transactions = transactions
        self.proof = proof
